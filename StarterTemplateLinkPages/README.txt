These files are for react app only (client side), the default page loaded is called Home referenced with a single back slash
(not "./"). App.js is still there from the original install of react-app but I wanted to make sure I knew how to do it for
any old set-up I want. These files show how to link pages with Route and BrowserRouter from react-router-dom and switch 
between them with a button (onClick functon). Look at whenever you add a new page make sure to add it in index.js so the router
knows that the page exists!
